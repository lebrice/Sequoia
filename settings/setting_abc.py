        Defines the training/evaluation procedure specific to this Setting.
        
        The training/evaluation loop can be defined however you want, as long as
        it respects the following constraints:
        
        1.  This method should always return either a float of a Results object
            that indicates the "performance" of this method on this setting.
             
        2. More importantly: You **have** to make sure that you do not break
            compatibility with more general methods targetting a parent setting!
            It should always be the case that all methods designed for any of
            this Setting's parents should also be applicable via polymorphism,
            i.e., anything that is defined to work on the class `Animal` should
            also work on the class `Cat`!
        
        3. While not enforced, it is strongly encourged that you define your
            training/evaluation routines at a pretty high level, so that Methods
            that get applied to your Setting can make use of pytorch-lightning's
            `Trainer` & `LightningDataModule` API to be neat and fast.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        method : Method
            A Method to apply on this Setting.
        config : Config
            Configuration object with things like the log dir, the data dir,
            cuda, wandb config, etc.

        Returns
        -------
        Results
            An object that is used to measure or quantify the performance of the
